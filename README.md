# Amazone-clone
<br>
This project is my take on recreating the Amazon website’s front-end using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s a static clone that helped me cement my basics in structuring web pages, crafting responsive layouts, and adding a sprinkle of interactivity—all without touching a backend. From styling the iconic navbar to assembling product cards and banners, I learned how to bring an e-commerce interface to life using just the core building blocks of the web.
